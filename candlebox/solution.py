"""
This assignment is called the candlebox problem. We have two persons A and B who start putting
candles in boxes at the ages of 4 and 3 respectively. It turns out that person B has put
candles in the wrong box over the years and the task is to find out how many candles we have
to remove from box A.
The first number is the difference in age between the two and the other two are
the number of candles in box A and B respectively.
Input example: 2
               26
               8
